# Template for parametrised reporting at INS

This repo holds a draft version for parametrised reports in Rmarkdown.  

Parameter features (the things that can be changed) include for now:  

 - center (level 1, level 2)
 - language
 - restrict_level (if pct-agreement per answer should be restricted if less than X answers were given per group to protect respondents). 
 
 Other features include:  
 
 - Logo in header. 
 - inclusion of Cover page from external pdfs.
